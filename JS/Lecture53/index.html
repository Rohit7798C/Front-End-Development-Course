    <!-- Events : Events are nothing but announcements
        e.g : Scrolling, clicking, double clicking, Key pressing
        - We are calling it announcement because some kind of action is attached with it that gets executed.
        - E.g: We can go to a certain website and go to console, and check for the events by using monitorEvents(document);
        - Using this, when we click or scroll on the page, the event like touchmove, mouseover, scroll, etc are visible.
        - We can stop seeing the events by using unmonitorEvents(document);


        Event-Target : It is a Type of Entity, where our event is received. It is a possibility that we may have applied an eventListener or eventHandler for this event.
        - E.g: Suppose we have a button on HTML web page, and someone clicks on that button, then that 'button is called as Event-target' and 'clicking the     button is called an Event.'
        - Action performed on clicking the button is stored at a location called eventListener.
        - E.g: Suppose we have a Video Player and it consists of play/pause button, clicking on which plays or pauses the video.
          So, here the button clicking action is called 'event' and the button is called 'event-target' and the 'action/behaviour' of playing or pausing is stored in the 'event-listener'.
        - We can add action/behaviour on the HTML element using addEventListener();
        - We can remove the action/behaviour from the HTML element using removeEventListener();
        - Syntax : 
          <event-target> .addEventListener(<event-type>,<function->action>)
              |                                 |                |
        event-target kya hoga             konsa event hoga     kya action perform hoga
            (button)                    (clicking, hovering)   particular event aane par.
     
    
        
        - Phases of an Event -
        - Suppose we have the following heirarchy structure.
        <div>
            <article>
                <h1>       </h1>
                <p>        </p>
            </artcile>
        </div>

        - So, the DOM structure will look like     div
                                                    |
                                                 article
                                                  /    \
                                                h1      p
        - So, here if we have a eventListener for clicking event on the <p>, then it flows from top to bottom manner from div -> article -> p
        - When we have a moving listener from div to p, 
        - The moment when it is between <div> and <article> i.e. it is moving from div to article (trying to move towards <p>) then that phase is called 'Capturing Phase' and the moment when it reached the <p> element it is called 'At-target phase'. 
        - And the third phase when we are going back upwards i.e. from <p> -> <article> -> <div>, is called 'BUBBLING PHASE'.
        
        - Whenever we are applying the addEventListener(), it is by default applied in the 'BUBBLING PHASE'.
        - Nothing happens in the 'At-target phase'.
        - Suppose, if we want the addEventListener() to get hitted in the Capturing Phase, for that we have to pass a value called 'useCapture' as 'true'
        - This is the Syntax for it : addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)
                                                       (click, function, true)
        - If we send true here, then the addEventListener() will be applied in the Capturing Phase.
        - It is NOT possible to add 'eventListeners' explicitly in 'target phase'. We can add them only in 'Capturing phase' or 'bubbling phase'.
    
    
    
    
        - Event Object -
        - Whenever an event is Triggered, let say a 'click-type' event is triggered, it firstly goes to the addEventListener('event') as a parameter or  argument.
        - Jab bhi koi event trigger hoga toh uska event-object eventListener ko mil jata hai.
        - And we can utilize this event to check what type of data is there.
