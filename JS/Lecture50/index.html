    <title>Error Handling in JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Error : Error is an event that impacts or disrupts the normal flow of execution of your Code</p>
    <pre>
        Steps of Execution of Js code :
            a. Firstly the code is parsed
            b. Converted into machine understandabe format.
            c. Finally executes
            
            **Parsing in JavaScript**:

             ->It's like carefully reading through the recipe (the code) and understanding what each ingredient (variable, function) is and what steps    (   (instructions) need to be followed in order to bake the cookies (execute the code).

             ->The browser (like your chef) takes the JavaScript code and breaks it down into a structure it can understand. This structure is called an   Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is a fancy way of saying it organizes the code in a way that makes sense for the browser to process it  efficiently.

        Types of Errors
        1. Compile Time Error
        -> These are the errors which are caught during parsing before the execution of the Program.

        2. Run-Time Error
        -> The errors which are found during the execution of the code are called Run-time errors.
