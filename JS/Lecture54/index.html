    <!-- IMP Questions -->
    <!--1) How to measure performance ?
            - Suppose I have two codes in front of me, then how will I find which code is faster?
         
        2) How can we write an efficient code ?
            - What good practices to follow ? 
        
        - Like in the previous lecture we were adding three paragraphs in one single <div>,
            So now if I want to insert 100 paras what will I have to do?
    
        
        
        - Reflow and Repaint - 
        1) Reflow :  It is the process of calculating the position/dimension of an element that we want to render on the page.
        - It is computationally intensive task, because it requires a lot of calculations.
        - It requires a lot of resources and time to perform it's task.
        - Suppose if we want to show any shape like Circle, Triangle or Square on the screen, for that this 'reflow' is only thing that calculates the dimensions of the particular shape and what is the location of showing the shape.
        - And after the calculation is done, it says that now I am ready and tell me where I have to paint or when I have to display it on the screen.

        2) Repaint : It is the process of displaying the element/content pixel-by-pixel on the screen.
        - Faster than the 'Reflow' process.


        //Now the main thing is that I want to write a code that should use minimum number of 'Reflows' & 'Repaints'.
        //Because lesser the no. of 'Reflows' and 'Repaints', more faster is the code.


        //Now Why was code 2 faster and why was code 1 slow?
        //For code 1
        - Because, for every para, when we are inserting it into the document, we have to perform 'reflow' and 'repaint' and this is done for 100 paras.
          So, it takes that much time
    
        //For code 2
        -
