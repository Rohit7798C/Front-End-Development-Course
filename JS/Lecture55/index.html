    <!-- Basics for Event Loop
    Q1) What is a Synchronous Code ? 
    Ans : It is a piece of code that executes at the same time, when the flow of execution reaches to it.
        e.g :
        flow of execution
            |->  console.log("Hi");      => Output -> Hi
            |->  console.log("Love");    => Output -> Love
            |->  console.log("Babbar");  => Output -> Babbar
        
        - Code does execution when 'flow of execution' reaches the code at the same time without needing to wait.
    
    
    Q2) What is a Asynchronous Code ?
    Ans : It is a piece of code that may or may not give instant execution even if the 'flow of execution' reaches that code.
        e.g : We have a setTimeout function in which we pass the 'function' and 'duration' as an input parameter.
            as setTimeout(function , duration).
            - Which tells us that run this 'function' after this much 'duration' of time.
            - Suppose we create a function 
                function sayMyName(){
                    console.log("Love Babbar!");                
                }
            - And use a setTimeout here below as, 
                setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000);         //5000 is in milliseconds

            - So, it may or may not execute/print after 5sec
            - It may execute in 10sec, 25sec, 1min, etc.
            - So, this is called Asynchronous function.
        - So, including setTimeout(), eventListeners, any network request, any AJAX request, any DB Connection request, all of these lie in the category of  Asynchronous code.
        - In case of android development, we always try to keep the asynchronous code(all types of requests) separate from the main thread(Most IMP) on which 
          the entire process is running, so that the main thread will never be 'blocked'.


    - Blocking -
    - Suppose we have the following code 
            console.log("Start");

            setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000);

            console.log("End");
        - So, it will instantly print "Start";
        - And flow of code goes to setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000), and this executes after 5 seconds.
        - Lastly after waiting for 5sec , it will print "End".

        - But what if we had a "Network Call" instead of setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000).
        - Now we have to wait indefinitely until we get the 'Response of Network Call', only after which we can print "End".
        - So, this part of code is called 'Blocked Code'. i.e. the print "End" code gets blocked for indefinite time.
    
        
    - So, for solving this blocking of code in an Asynchronous code, we have 'Event Loop' in JavaScript.
    
    - There are 3 components to be taken care of in Event Loops.
        1) Call Stack : We know that whenever a function is called, it enters into a Stack, and when the function completes, it's entry is removed from the Stack.

        2) Browsers : Used for Handling Asynchronous functions

        3) CallBack / Task Queue : 
    
    - Suppose I have the following program :
        console.log("start");

        setTimeOut(sayMyname, 5000);             ______
                                         _______|     |_______ This is Browser
        console.log("End");        ______|                    |_____
                                  |   setTimeOut(sayMyName,5000)   |
            |        |         -> |_____(Executes this function____|
            |        |         |        |____after 5000ms)____|
            |        |         |               |______|
            |        |         |Handovered to Browser
 executes ->|3rd line|         |(Because it is a Asynchronous function)
            |2nd Line|---------|(And if Call Stack executes this function, it will cause blocking)
 executes ->|1st line|          (When this function is handled over the browser, it is removed from the Stack).
            ----------
